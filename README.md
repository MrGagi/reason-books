This is just me trying to learn ReasonML and ReasonReact, with this you can search books through Google Books API. I probabbly will continue to play with this until I build something with my API to store books.

## What's this?

## Run App

You can run this app with 

```
yarn start
```

Also you need to set your Google Books API Key in config.js.
